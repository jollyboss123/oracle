# oracle
Oracle is an application designed to calculate the Value at Risk (VaR) of a given portfolio. 
It leverages the MapReduce approach to handle large datasets and parallelize the computation process, and provide accurate risk assessments.

### Value at Risk
It represents the **maximum expected loss** over a certain time period.

### Conditional Value at Risk
This is defined as the expected loss **beyond** VaR, or more formally, we look at **the average of the distribution beyond the VaR**, that is of those returns which are less than the VaR.
